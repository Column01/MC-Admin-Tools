# NBT Unstuffer (WIP)
- Place `level.dat` file in `level/`
- Place player data in `playerdata/`
- Run and it should (atm) find all instances of ME drives and some backpacks.

## Dependencies
- [nbtlib](https://pypi.org/project/nbtlib/) (HUGE thanks to vberlier for making this!)

#### Create a GitHub issue with names of backpacks or ME drives if I missed any (WHICH I KNOW I DID)
